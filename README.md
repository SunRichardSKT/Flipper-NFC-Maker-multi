# NFC Tag Generator

This project provides a simple web-based tool for generating NFC tag data compatible with Flipper Zero devices. Users can create NFC tags for URLs, phone numbers, and text, which can then be used with Flipper Zero for various NFC interactions.

## Features

- Generate NFC tag data for URLs, phone numbers, and plain text
- Compatible with Flipper Zero NFC format
- Dynamic file naming based on input data
- Dark mode toggle for better visibility
- Downloadable .nfc files

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Select the type of NFC tag you want to create (URL, Phone, or Text).
3. Enter the data for your NFC tag in the input field.
4. Click the "Generate NFC Data" button.
5. Review the generated NFC data.
6. Click the "Download NFC File" button to save the data as a .nfc file.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the user interface.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the NFC data generation logic.

## Technical Details

The NFC tag generator creates data for NTAG215 chips, which are commonly used in NFC applications. The generated data follows the NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) specification and is formatted to be compatible with Flipper Zero devices.

### Supported NFC Types

- URL: Generates a URL record with appropriate URI prefixes.
- Phone: Creates a telephone number record.
- Text: Produces a plain text record.
